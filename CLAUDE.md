# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"How The Horsey Moves" — a free, open-source chess puzzle trainer for young students in classroom settings. Built with SvelteKit (Svelte 5 runes) + TypeScript (strict mode). No chat, no ads, no memberships, no server compute — everything is client-side. Deployed to Vercel.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build        # Production build
npm run check        # TypeScript + Svelte diagnostics (svelte-kit sync + svelte-check)
```

No test framework is configured.

## Architecture

**Three-layer design**: chess logic → state management → Svelte UI.

### Chess Logic (`src/lib/logic/`)
- `types.ts` — Core types: `PieceKind`, `PieceColor`, `SquareId` (union of all 64 squares), `BoardState` (Map-based, immutable). FEN parser via `parseFen()`. Position hashing via `boardToKey()` (used for threefold repetition)
- `moves.ts` — Pure functions for move generation per piece type. Sliding pieces (R/B/Q) use direction arrays; step pieces (K/N) use offset arrays; pawns have special forward/capture/en-passant logic
- `attacks.ts` — `isSquareAttacked()`, `isInCheck()`, `isCheckmate()`, `isStalemate()`, `getLegalMoves()`, `getAllLegalMoves()`
- `pgn.ts` — PGN parsers. Flat `parsePgn()` for simple move lists; tree-based `parseGamePgn()` → `GameTree`/`GameNode` with full variation support (`(...)` syntax), comments, NAGs, arrows. `extractMainLine(tree)` flattens to `ParsedGame` for backward compat / test mode. Exports `parseSan()` and `applyMove()` (also used by openings parser). Supports comments (`{text}`), NAGs (`!`, `!!`), arrows (`[%cal Ge2e4]`)
- `bot.ts` — Bot move selection: `pickBotMove(board, color, level)`. `"random"` = any legal move; `"basic"` = one-ply scored evaluation
- `endgame.ts` — Mate conversion logic for KQK, KRRK, KRK, KBBK, KBNK endgames

### Puzzle System (`src/lib/puzzles/`)
- `types.ts` — Discriminated union `Puzzle = RoutePuzzle | TacticPuzzle | ConversionPuzzle`:
  - `RoutePuzzle` (`type: "route"`) — navigate a piece to target stars, avoid walls. Has `playerPiece`, `position`, `walls`, `stars`, `starThresholds`, optional `arrows`/`threats`
  - `TacticPuzzle` (`type: "puzzle"`) — Lichess-style FEN+PGN tactic. Has `fen`, `pgn`, optional `demo`/`starThresholds`
  - `ConversionPuzzle` (`type: "conversion"`) — play against a bot to checkmate or promote. Has `position`, `bot`, `goal`, `starThresholds`
- Per-piece files (`rook.ts`, `bishop.ts`, etc.) + `castling.ts`, `enpassant.ts`, `checkmate.ts`, `tactics.ts`
- `index.ts` — Registry with `getPuzzlesForPiece()`, `PIECES`, `CATEGORIES` (with `comingSoon` support for subcategories)

### Model Games (`src/lib/games/`)
- `types.ts` — `ModelGame` interface
- `index.ts` — 14 classical games (Greco through Kasparov) with PGN strings. Most are unannotated — user annotates via Lichess studies, then pastes PGN with `{comments}` and `[%cal ...]` arrows

### Opening Trainer (`src/lib/openings/`)
- `index.ts` — PGN variation parser (`parseOpeningPgn`), line extractor, opening data
- Parses `(variation)` syntax into a tree, extracts all root-to-leaf lines
- Student plays one color; opponent moves auto-play with animation
- Learn mode: arrows show each move. Practice mode: arrows only on mistakes

### State (`src/lib/state/`)
- `progress-store.ts` — Svelte writable store, persists to localStorage (`"horsey-progress"`). Sequential unlock: puzzle N requires N-1 completed
- `use-puzzle.svelte.ts` — State factory for gameplay: board state, move validation, drag-and-drop, star calculation, side-effects, multi-step solution validation
- `use-game.svelte.ts` — State factory for Play vs Computer: castling, promotion, bot moves, threefold repetition detection via `boardToKey()`
- `sound.ts` — WAV file playback (`/sounds/*.wav`) with mute toggle persisted to localStorage. Four sounds: `move`, `correct`, `wrong`, `stars`. Used by puzzles, game, and endgame trainers

### Components (`src/lib/components/`)
- `board/Board.svelte` — SVG-based 800x800 board with drag-and-drop, click-to-move, valid move indicators, target stars, arrows, slide animations, danger-square overlays. `readOnly` prop skips animations (used by game viewer). `playableColors` prop allows playing both sides (used by game viewer test mode). `dangerSquares` prop highlights squares with red semi-transparent overlay
- `board/CoordinateTrainer.svelte` — Timed 30s square-naming mini-game. Stars: 3 for 10+, 2 for 5+, 1 for 3+. Best score/stars persisted to localStorage (`coord-best`, `coord-best-stars`). Standalone from puzzle progress system
- `board/SetupTrainer.svelte` — 7 stages: place rooks, knights, bishops, king, queen, pawns, then full setup. Each stage individually addressable via `/setup/[stage]`. Exports `SETUP_STAGES` via `<script module>`. Supports click-click and drag-from-tray. Stars based on mistakes: 0=3, 1-2=2, 3+=1. Per-stage localStorage: `setup-{slug}-best-stars`
- `puzzle/PuzzleShell.svelte` — Main puzzle container. Hides target stars when `puzzle.arrows` is set
- `game/GameViewer.svelte` — PGN game viewer with path-based navigation (`currentPath: GameNode[]`), auto-play, keyboard nav (`<svelte:window>`), comments, arrows. Variations display inline in the move grid. "Pause at variations" toggle stops auto-play at branch points. Test mode uses `extractMainLine()` for flat main-line-only memorization
- `game/GameShell.svelte` — Play vs Computer wrapper, accepts `botLevel` prop
- `opening/OpeningTrainer.svelte` — Opening repertoire trainer with learn/practice phases
- `endgame/EndgameShell.svelte` — KPK bitbase trainer (`src/lib/logic/kpk-bitbase.ts`: 24KB retrograde analysis). Bot plays perfect defense via bitbase; validates student moves must maintain winning evaluation. Win condition: pawn reaches rank 8. Stars: 0 mistakes=3, 1=2, 2+=1
- `endgame/MateTrainer.svelte` — Mate conversion trainer (KQK, KRRK, KRK, KBBK, KBNK)
- `endgame/DrawTrainer.svelte` — "Hold the draw" trainer. Student plays Black (defender), bot plays White (attacker). Bot uses simple evaluation (pawn advancement, captures, centralization). Win = draw achieved (stalemate, threefold repetition, 50-move rule). Lose = checkmate or clean promotion (bot promotes and student can't capture). Uses `boardToKey()` for threefold detection
- `lessons/HowToWinLesson.svelte` + `how-to-win-data.ts` — 15-step guided lesson: check → escaping check (move/capture/block) → giving check → checkmate demo → stalemate demo → 5 mate-in-1 practice → 2 don't-stalemate practice. Validation modes: "any", "check", "checkmate", "no-stalemate". Stars based on mistakes. localStorage: `how-to-win-best-stars`
- `blindfold/` — 20 blindfold/visualization components (24 trainers total — BlindfoldMate handles 5 endgame types), all standalone localStorage keys. Includes: ColorOfSquare, SameDiagonal, SameRankFile, MoveCounting, KnightRoutes, BishopRoutes, PieceReachability, NeighborSquares, KnightSquares, RelativePosition, WhatChanged, WhereDidItLand, FlashPosition, PieceCount, RookMaze, BlindTactics, BlindfoldPuzzle, KnightGauntlet, GuardingGame, BlindfoldMate

### Routing (`src/routes/`)
- `/` — Landing page with four sections: **Basics**, **Practice**, **Study**, **Vision**
- `/practice` — Practice hub (checkmate, tactics, endings, advanced endings)
- `/study` — Study hub (openings, model games, puzzle creator)
- `/vision` — Vision hub (24 blindfold/visualization trainers)
- `/learn/[piece]` — Puzzle list, category hub, endgame trainers, blindfold trainers, How to Win hub/sections
- `/learn/[piece]/[puzzleId]` — Individual puzzle or How to Win lesson step
- `/board` — Board hub; `/board/coordinates` — Coordinate trainer
- `/setup` — Place the Pieces stage list; `/setup/[stage]` — individual stage
- `/games`, `/games/[gameId]` — Model game viewer
- `/openings`, `/openings/[id]` — Opening repertoire trainer
- `/play` — Play vs computer
- `/editor` — Puzzle creator (place pieces, generate FEN strings)
- `/about` — Privacy, COPPA, credits, license, administrator info

### Lichess Puzzles (`src/lib/puzzles/lichess-*.ts`)
- Practice puzzles sourced from the Lichess puzzle database (CC0 public domain)
- Generated by `scripts/filter-lichess.py` from the full 5.8M puzzle CSV
- Filtered by: rating < 1200, white-to-move only, low piece count, same piece type across all player moves
- 7 generated files: `lichess-mate1.ts`, `lichess-mate2.ts`, `lichess-forks.ts`, `lichess-skewers.ts`, `lichess-pins.ts`, `lichess-removing-defender.ts`, `lichess-discovered.ts`
- Integrated into the standard puzzle system via `PuzzleShell` — no separate trainer component
- Lichess pins are appended after hand-authored pin puzzles in the same puzzle set
- To regenerate: download `lichess_db_puzzle.csv.zst` from database.lichess.org, decompress, run the script with python-chess in a venv

## Deployment

Vercel auto-deploys on `git push` — no manual deployment steps needed. Uses `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` with `runtime: 'nodejs22.x'`.

## Svelte 5 Conventions

This codebase uses **Svelte 5 runes mode** exclusively. Follow these patterns:

### State & Reactivity
- **`$state()`** for reactive variables: `let count = $state(0)`
- **Typed state** uses generic syntax: `let items = $state<string[]>([])` — NOT `let items: string[] = $state([])`
- **`$derived()`** for computed values: `let doubled = $derived(count * 2)`
- **`$derived.by()`** for complex computations that need a function body
- **`$effect()`** for side effects (DOM updates, timers, localStorage). Avoid updating state inside effects — use `$derived` instead
- **`onMount()`** for one-time browser-only initialization (localStorage reads, interval setup with cleanup)
- **`$props()`** for component inputs: `let { piece, onNext }: Props = $props()`

### Components
- **Dynamic components**: use a PascalCase variable directly as a tag — `<MyComponent />`. Do NOT use `<svelte:component this={...}>` (deprecated in runes mode). Variable names MUST start with a capital letter for Svelte to treat them as components
- **Props interface**: declare with `interface Props { ... }` then destructure with `$props()`
- **`{#key value}`** blocks to force re-mount when a value changes (replaces React's `key` prop)
- **Component-level exports**: use `<script lang="ts" module>` for non-component exports (e.g., `SETUP_STAGES`). For larger data exports, use separate `.ts` files
- **Self-closing tags**: `<Component />` is fine for components; for HTML elements use `<div></div>`

### Styling
- **Scoped CSS** in `<style>` blocks — no Tailwind
- **Conditional classes** use array syntax (Svelte 5.16+): `class={['card', isActive && 'active']}` — NOT `class:active={isActive}` (legacy directive)
- CSS custom properties for theming: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--card-bg`, `--card-border`, `--text-muted`, `--text-faint`, `--btn-bg`, `--btn-hover`

### Events & DOM
- **Event handlers**: `onclick`, `onkeydown`, `onsubmit` — NOT `on:click` (Svelte 4 syntax)
- **SVG a11y**: interactive SVGs need `role="application"` and `aria-label`; display-only SVGs need `role="img"` and `aria-label`. Never suppress a11y warnings with `svelte-ignore` — fix the underlying accessibility issue instead
- **Keyboard nav**: use `<svelte:window onkeydown={handler} />` for global keyboard shortcuts

### Imports
- **`import type { X }`** for type-only imports (prevents Rollup "not exported" warnings)
- **Path alias**: `$lib/` maps to `src/lib/`
- Static assets live in `static/` (not `public/`)

### Translation Cheatsheet (React → Svelte 5)

| React/Next.js | SvelteKit (Svelte 5) |
|---|---|
| `useState(x)` | `let x = $state(x)` |
| `useState<Type>(x)` | `let x = $state<Type>(x)` |
| `useCallback(fn, [deps])` | `function fn() { ... }` |
| `useEffect(() => { ... }, [deps])` | `$effect(() => { ... })` |
| `useMemo(() => val, [deps])` | `let val = $derived(...)` |
| `useRef(null)` | `let el = $state<El \| null>(null)` + `bind:this={el}` |
| `useContext(Ctx)` | `import { store } from '$lib/state/...'` |
| `className="x"` | `class="x"` or `class={['x', cond && 'y']}` |
| `Link href="/x"` | `<a href="/x">` |
| `use(params)` | `page.params` via `$app/state` |
| `useRouter().push(x)` | `goto(x)` via `$app/navigation` |
| `"use client"` | Not needed |
| `@/lib/foo` | `$lib/foo` |
| `key={id}` | `{#key id}...{/key}` |

## Key Conventions

- Many students using this app cannot read yet. All interactive elements (puzzles, lessons, trainers) should be figure-out-able from visual cues alone: arrows, colors, icons, and board state. Text instructions are helpful for those who can read but must not be the only signal. Use universal symbols (trophies, checkmarks, red/green colors) over text labels
- Landing page has four sections: Basics, Practice, Study, Vision. Practice/Study/Vision are always visible. Celebration banner with DVD-screensaver knight animation when all basics are 3-starred
- Basics cards have step numbers (1-9) with green checkmarks when complete, yellow glow + "Start here!"/"Up next!" badge on the first incomplete card
- Castling puzzles are merged into King, en passant puzzles are merged into Pawn (source files remain separate: `castling.ts`, `enpassant.ts` — combined in `index.ts` registry)
- "Continue" button above Basics grid links directly to the next unsolved puzzle. "Play a Game!" card (step 7) in Basics links to `/play?level=random`
- Cross-category "Next" button: last puzzle in a basics category shows "Continue to Bishop!" etc., last pawn puzzle shows "Continue to The Board!"
- Full basics flow: puzzles (rook→...→pawn) → The Board (Name the Square + Place the Pieces) → How to Win → Play a Game. Each section's completion screen links to the next
- Play page accepts `?level=random` or `?level=basic` query param to skip the level selector
- Stars on category/piece cards only show when ALL puzzles in that set are completed (mastery indicator, not best-single-puzzle)
- Board state is immutable — new `BoardState` created per move, never mutated
- Chess piece SVGs live in `static/pieces/` named `{color}{piece}.svg` (e.g., `wR.svg`, `bN.svg`)
- No backend/database — all state is client-side localStorage
- Obstacle pieces on puzzles are white pawns (so they can't be captured by the player's white piece)
- Puzzle `setup` accepts either a `PiecePlacement[]` array or a FEN string
- FEN strings auto-extract castling rights and en passant square from fields 3-4
- This codebase is designed to be hand-maintained by a human chess teacher — prefer simple, readable formats
- Avoid `eslint-disable` and `svelte-ignore` comments — fix the root cause instead

## Workflow

- After completing a task, always offer to commit and push so Vercel can deploy
- Run `npm run build` before committing to catch errors early
- Run `npm run check` to catch type errors and Svelte warnings that the build doesn't flag
- The user often makes hand-edits to puzzle files while Claude works — always `git diff --stat` before committing and include their changed files
- When pushing fails due to remote changes, `git pull --rebase` then push again
- Do NOT try to programmatically verify checkmate positions — push and let the user test in-browser
- Claude generates PGNs from memory and they often contain errors (wrong moves mid-game). Always flag generated PGNs as needing user verification. Major chess databases (chessgames.com, Wikipedia, 365chess) block WebFetch (403), but smaller sites may work. If a PGN fails parsing, diagnose the exact failing move and let the user fix it rather than burning tokens on speculative web searches
- PGN annotations: `{comments}`, NAGs (`!`, `!!`), arrows (`[%cal Ge2e4]`). Lichess color convention: G=green, R=red, Y=yellow, B=blue

## Puzzle Authoring Notes

- The user is a chess teacher — puzzle accuracy matters. When creating checkmate puzzles, carefully trace all king escape squares
- Claude can help with puzzle infrastructure (multi-move support, opponent responses, arrows, UI) but the user should verify chess positions for tactical correctness
- Tactics puzzles use arrows (not target stars) to show tactical relationships, and `opponentResponses` for multi-move sequences
- Subcategories can be marked `comingSoon: true` in CATEGORIES to show as grayed-out placeholders
- Checkmate categories: Queen Takes f7, Queen-Bishop Battery, Lolli's Mate, Smothered Mate, Back Rank Mate, Rook Ladder, Queen & King, Mate in 1, Mate in 2
- Tactics categories: Pins, Skewers, Forks, Removing the Defender, Discovered Attacks — all have Lichess practice puzzles
- Puzzle IDs use a prefix matching their category (e.g., `tactics-pin-01`, `checkmate-qb-01`, `lichess-fork-01`)
- Blindfold trainers all use standalone localStorage keys (not puzzle progress system)

## Opening Trainer Notes

- PGN with variations: `1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 (2...d6 3.d4) 3.Bb5` — parenthesized sections are alternative lines
- Student plays one side (white), opponent auto-responds
- Lines are trained sequentially: main line first, then variations rewind to branch point
- Learn phase shows arrows; practice phase hides them unless the student makes a mistake

## Bot System (`src/lib/logic/bot.ts`)

- Three levels: `"random"` (any legal move), `"basic"` (one-ply evaluation), and `"intermediate"` (depth-2 minimax with alpha-beta pruning)
- Basic bot scores each legal move by: captures (trade up), checkmate delivery (+1000), checkmate defense (-500 if move allows opponent mate-in-1), piece safety, check bonus, center control, castling, pawn advancement
- Intermediate bot: depth-2 minimax search with alpha-beta pruning. Uses piece-square tables (standard simplified PSTs from Chess Programming Wiki) for static evaluation. Handles promotion, castling, and en passant in move simulation. Captures sorted first for better pruning (~35×35 = ~1,225 positions worst case, typically much less with pruning). Instant on Chromebooks
- `createGameState(botLevel)` in `use-game.svelte.ts` creates the game state factory; `GameShell` passes it through
- Play page (`/play`) shows a level selector before starting the game
- Adding new levels: add to `BotLevel` type, handle in `pickBotMove()`
